pingfs - "True cloud storage"
	by Erik Ekman <erik@kryo.se>

pingfs aims to be a filesystem where the data is stored only in the Internet
itself, as ICMP Echo packets (pings) travelling from you to remote servers and
back again.

It is implemented using raw sockets and FUSE, so superuser powers are required.
Linux is the only intended target OS, portability will not be a goal.
Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported.

Compile by just running 'make'

How to start it:
- Create a textfile with hostname and IP addresses to target
- As root, run ./pingfs <filename> <mountpoint>
  It will resolve all hostnames, and then test each resolved address
  if it responds properly to a number of pings.
  Some statistics will be printed and then the filesystem will be mounted.
- Write data to a new file (only one write allowed per file)
- The first 1kB per file will be sent over and over to remote hosts via ICMP.
- Files should be readable. The data is returned as soon as it returns back
  from the remote host.
- Stop with ^C, and it should unmount itself.
- Otherwise unmount with fusermount -u <mountpoint>
