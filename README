pingfs - "True cloud storage"
	by Erik Ekman <erik@kryo.se>

pingfs aims to be a filesystem where the data is stored only in the Internet
itself, as ICMP Echo packets (pings) travelling from you to remote servers and
back again.

It will be implemented using raw sockets and FUSE, so superuser powers are
required. Linux is the intended target OS, portability will not be a goal.
Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported.

How to start it: (does not do anything fun yet)
- Compile by running make
- Create a textfile with hostname and IP addresses to target
- As root, run ./pingfs <filename>
  It will resolve all hostnames, and then test each resolved address
  if it responds properly to a number of pings.
  Some statistics will be printed and the program exits.
